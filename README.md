| Location   | Magdeburg, Germany                      |

| Frameworks | Laravel, TailwindCSS, VueJS             |

I program websites since 2018. Since then I gathered a lot of experience-points with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

Since 2019 I work as a developer for the systems and the website of my school, the Werner-von-Siemens Gymnasium Magdeburg. My specialty is account- and database-management. There I work with MySQL, Laravel and VueJS.

In my free time I develop Build_42's Web-Framework, which is for example used in this website.

I also learned Python for some diy-projects to control or read out electric components. Now I use it to automate repetetive workloads.

I always like to learn new technologies for new projects and get used to existing systems.
