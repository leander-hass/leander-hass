# About me
Hi, I am Leander Hass. I'm a Developer from Magdeburg, Germany.
I speak English and German fluently.

## Coding-Languages
### HTML
I started programming my first Webpage in 7th Grade in School.

Since then I rapidly caught up with HTML5 and I'm staying up to Date with the newest Develolments.

### CSS
When you are Developing a Website CSS is a Must Have. 

I'm interested in newest Hacks and Technologies and love getting creative with it. I of course use CSS3.

### PHP
The last Language I started learning in School was PHP.

I have some Experience with MySQL but I am more interested in Developing Backend-Frameworks, APIs and useful Tools like Compilers and Compressors.

### JavaScript
In JS I am experienced but I am still learning some Advanced Concepts. As soon as there is a Need for a Feature I am able to find ways and Methods.
Therefore I am staying up to Date with the current Standard of ECMA6.

### Python
I started using Python to program Sofwtare-Tools for myself and to interface Hardware-Components on my Raspberry Pi.
Therefore I am not a Pro but I am able to implement everything I want.
